    Pay attention to the verb conjugation for "to be" in the present tense.
    Think about the correct case to use for the noun "door".
    The verb "to leave" is in the infinitive form.
    The adverb "out" indicates direction.
    Use the correct preposition to indicate location.
    Figure out the correct word order for the question clause.
    Your Turn!
    Try to transcribe the sentence into Russian using the vocabulary table and clues provided. Good luck!
    Note: Refer to your Russian language knowledge to conjugate the verbs and decline the nouns correctly. Figure out the correct particles to use with the prepositions and verbs.

    Well done!
    Your transcription "Медведи у дверь" is mostly correct!
    Here's a slight correction:
    "Медведи у двери"
    You were missing the prepositional case ending "-и" on the word "дверь". In Russian, when using the preposition "у" (meaning "at" or "near"), the noun that follows should be in the genitive case.
    Keep going! You're doing great!
    Try to complete the rest of the sentence: "did you leave the garbage out?"
